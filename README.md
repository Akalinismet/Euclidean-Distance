# Euclidean-Distance
Euclidean Distance Calculations with Python

Euclidean distance is the "ordinary" straight-line distance between two points in Euclidean space. With this formula, we can find the distance between two points in a plane or three-dimensional space using Python by utilizing concepts of functions and loops.

**Definition of Points:**

We create a list named *'points'*. This list should contain tuples representing points in 2D space. For example, the point '(x, y)' will be represented as a tuple '(x, y)'.

**Writing a Function for Euclidean Distance:**

We define a function named *'euclideanDistance'*. This function should take two tuples (each representing a point) and return the Euclidean distance between these two points.

**Calculating Distances:**

Using a loop, we calculate the Euclidean distance between each pair of points in the *'points'* list. Store these distances in another list named *'distances'*.

**Finding the Minimum Distance:**

Find the minimum distance from the *'distances'* list and print it to the screen.
